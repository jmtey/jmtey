- 👋 Hi, I’m @jmtey
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Visualization, Data Analytics and Business Intelligence. 
-  Basically, My interest in Business Intelligence, Data Analytics and Data Visualization started back in 2015 when I was firstly introduced to a tool called QlikView
and thereafter to other data visualisation tools and some basic machine learning concepts while working at Deloitte, although I have been working in the IT industry since 2011 after graduating
- 🌱 I’m passionate about finding solutions using data and Information technology.
- 💞️ I like football, reading books(not huge novel though - as I would rather watch a movie about it or something like that)
- 📫 I can be to reached at jamte2006@yahoo.com
